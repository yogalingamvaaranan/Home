				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>
					Hi, my name is Vaaranan Yogalingam. I'm an amateur Canadian photographer. I have been doing photography for 3 years now. The camera I use 
					is digital, and not a DSLR. The camera I use now is a Nikon Coolpix P530. This camera was my first camera that I used to take most of my 
					pictures that I take professionally, and sell, to share on social media, etc. My very first camera that I had ever used was a Sony DSCW830. This 
					camera was our family camera, and I would take it with me to school field trips to take pictures.

				<p>
					Most of my photos are taken in the city I live in, "Toronto". Many of Toronto's natural and manmade features have inspired a lot of my photos, 
					especially Toronto's most notable landmark, the CN Tower. When an average person takes a photo, they would usually just take a direct photo of the 
					object. Although that is a common method, it is not the kind of style of photography I tend to use. In my photography, I try to make my photos more 
					unique by emphasizing on angles, colour, and contrast in my photos. I take the time to compare multiple angled shots to see which one has the best 
					impact on the viewer.
